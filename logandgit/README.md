Welcome to the homework problems for your application for a Mozilla SRE role!

This repository contains a `problem*/` subdirectory for each problem.

You can use the `run.sh` script to run all test cases for one of the problems. You can use `../run.sh` inside a problem directory to run all test cases for the current problem. See `./run.sh --help` for more information.

The `Dockerfile` in each subdirectory is preconfigured to use Python. If you want to use a different programming language, please adjust the `Dockerfile` accordingly â€“ this allows both you and us to use `run.sh` to run your code.

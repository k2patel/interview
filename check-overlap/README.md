This implementation defines two structs: dateRange, which represents a date range with start and end times, and overlapResponse, which represents the response with a boolean overlap property.

The checkOverlap function is the HTTP handler function for the /check-overlap endpoint. It parses the request body into a struct, checks if the date ranges overlap using a simple algorithm, creates the response struct and encodes it to JSON, and writes the JSON response back to the client.

Note that this implementation assumes that the client sends date ranges in ISO 8601 format with timezone offset, as described in the API design. If the client sends dates in a different format or timezone, the code may need to be adapted to handle that.


Endpoint: /check-overlap

Request Method: POST

Request Body:

json
```
{
  "range1": {
    "start": "2022-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "end": "2022-01-10T00:00:00Z"
  },
  "range2": {
    "start": "2022-01-05T00:00:00Z",
    "end": "2022-01-15T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```
The request body contains two date ranges, range1 and range2, each represented as an object with start and end properties. The date and time values are in ISO 8601 format with timezone offset (e.g., 2022-01-01T00:00:00Z for midnight UTC on January 1st, 2022).

Response Body:json

```
{
  "overlap": true
}
```
The response body contains a single boolean property overlap, which indicates whether the two date ranges overlap (true) or not (false).

Error Response:

If the request body is missing or malformed, the server should return a 400 Bad Request response with a JSON error message: json
```
{
  "error": "Invalid request body"
}
```
If the request body is valid but the date ranges do not overlap, the server should return a 200 OK response with a JSON body containing `overlap: false`.

Example Usage:

To check if two date ranges overlap, the client can send a POST request to the `/check-overlap` endpoint with the date ranges in the request body:

bash
```
POST /check-overlap HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "range1": {
    "start": "2022-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "end": "2022-01-10T00:00:00Z"
  },
  "range2": {
    "start": "2022-01-05T00:00:00Z",
    "end": "2022-01-15T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```
If the date ranges overlap, the server would respond with a 200 OK response and a JSON body containing `{"overlap": true}`. If the date ranges do not overlap, the server would respond with a 200 OK response and a JSON body containing `{"overlap": false}`.

This workflow uses the `docker/build-push-action` action to build and push the Docker image to Docker Hub. It also installs and configures kubectl to deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster. 

Note that you need to set the `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` secrets in your repository settings for Docker Hub authentication, and the `KUBECONFIG` secret for Kubernetes authentication. 
The `KUBECONFIG` secret should contain the base64-encoded contents of your Kubernetes configuration file.

## Programming challenge description:
Given two axis-aligned rectangles A and B, determine if the two overlap. The rectangles considered overlapping if they have at least one common point.
## Input:
Your program should read lines from standard input. Each line contains 8 comma-separated coordinates. The coordinates are upper left x of A, upper left y of A, lower right x of A, lower right y of A, upper left x of B, upper left y of B, lower right x of B, lower right y of B.
## Output:
Print out True if A and B intersect, False otherwise.

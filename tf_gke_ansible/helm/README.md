This YAML file defines a Deployment that creates 3 replicas of an Nginx container, and a Service that exposes the port and creates a Load Balancer for the Deployment.

You can then apply this YAML file using the following kubectl command:

`kubectl apply -f nginx.yaml`

This will create the Deployment and Service in your GKE cluster. You can check the status of the Deployment and Service using the following commands:


`kubectl get deployments`
`kubectl get services`

Once the Service is created, you can access the Nginx webserver by visiting the IP address of the Load Balancer created by the Service. You can get the IP address of the Load Balancer using the following command:

`kubectl get services hellonx-unqork`
`kubectl describe deployment nginx-deployment`

This will output the external IP address of the Load Balancer. You can then visit this IP address in a web browser to see the Nginx welcome page.
